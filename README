This is a program for computing Wasserstein distances between persistence diagrams
using the geometric version of auction algorithm.

Requires boost 1.58 or higher.
After compilation with make an executable wasserstein appears in build/default.
(Alternatively, one can build the code using CMake:
    mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make)

Usage:   wasserstein  file1 file2 [wasserstein_power] [relative_error]. 
By default power is 1.0, relative error is 0.01.

file1 and file2 must contain persistence diagrams in plain text format 
(no headers, no comments, one point per line):

x_1 y_1
...
x_n y_n
