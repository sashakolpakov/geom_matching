This is a program for computing Wasserstein distances between persistence diagrams
using the geometric version of auction algorithm.

Requires boost 1.58 or higher.
After compilation with make an executable wasserstein appears in build/default.
(Alternatively, one can build the code using CMake:
    mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make)

Usage:   wasserstein  file1 file2 [wasserstein_degree] [relative_error] [internal_p]

file1 and file2 must contain persistence diagrams in plain text format 
(no headers, no comments, one point per line):

x_1 y_1
...
x_n y_n

Wasserstein distance $W_{q, p}(X, Y)$ between two persistent diagrams is
the minimum over all perfect matchings between $X$ and $Y$ ( $y(x)$ is the point of $Y$
matched to $x \in X$ ) of the following expression:
$ ( \sum \| x - y(x) \|_p ^ { q } ) ^ { 1 / q} $

Parameter wasserstein_degree corresponds to $q$, when it tends to infinity,
Wasserstein distance tends to the bottleneck distance.

Parameter internal_p corresponds to p.

Default values: 
wasserstein_degree  = 1.0, 
relative_error = 0.01, 
internal_p = infinity.

Valid values: 
wasserstein_degree must be in $[1.0, \infinity)$, 
relative_error must be positive,
internal_p must be in $[1.0, \infinity]$ (to explicitly set internal_p to $\infinity$, supply inf).
